Privacy Policy for SpongeBot

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how SpongeBot operates and handles user data while running on Discord servers.

2. Data Collection
SpongeBot does not permanently collect, store, or share any personal or server data. Specifically:

SpongeBot processes commands entered by users in real-time and logs these commands and their outputs temporarily in the console for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.
These logs are not stored permanently and are cleared when the bot restarts or the hosting environment is refreshed.
No user IDs, messages, or other identifiable information are shared externally.

3. Media Files
SpongeBot generates random screenshots from full episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants stored locally on the Bot owner's hard drive.
These episodes are privately owned and hosted exclusively on the server where SpongeBot operates. They are not distributed, shared, or accessible outside of this environment.
SpongeBot uses the locally installed FFmpeg software to process these episodes and generate requested content.
All processing occurs locally, and no data is sent to external servers during this process.

4. User Commands
Commands entered by users are processed in real-time to provide responses or generate requested content.
Temporary logs of commands and outputs are used solely for debugging purposes and are not stored permanently.

5. Third-Party Services
SpongeBot does not rely on third-party services for processing or storing data. All operations are performed locally on the server where SpongeBot is hosted.

6. Security
SpongeBot is hosted on a private server with restricted access.
Efforts are made to secure SpongeBot and its hosting environment to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

7. Changes to This Policy
The Bot owner reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be communicated through SpongeBotâ€™s support channels or documentation.

8. Contact Information
For questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the Bot owner at [your contact email or Discord handle].
